# Architecture

How the School Organiser is built and deployed. Cross-references [DATA_MODEL.md](DATA_MODEL.md)
for the schema and [SECURITY_AND_PRIVACY.md](SECURITY_AND_PRIVACY.md) for data handling.

## Architectural goals

1. **Glanceable and instant on the LAN.** Server-rendered HTML, minimal JS, sub-150 ms perceived.
2. **Useful without the LLM.** Timetable, notes, tasks and time logging all work with the AI
   provider offline. AI is additive.
3. **One language, one database.** TypeScript on the server; PostgreSQL for relational *and*
   vector data (pgvector), exactly as `exam_questions` does — so code and patterns are shared.
4. **The clock is a first-class service.** "What am I teaching now?" is computed from weekday +
   time + term dates + one-off exceptions, in one place, testable in isolation.
5. **Replaceable LLM.** All AI calls go through one wrapper (redaction + audit + provider swap).
6. **Boring on purpose.** Standard HTTP, standard SQL, Docker Compose, nightly backups. One
   server, one user.

## Recommended stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language/runtime | **TypeScript on Node 24** (`.nvmrc` → 22 for Debian parity) | Matches `exam_questions`; share code. |
| Web framework | **Fastify 5** | Same as `exam_questions`; fast, schema-first. |
| Rendering | **Server-rendered templates + HTMX** | Quick partial updates (note autosave, "log actual", inline edits) without a SPA. |
| Styling | Tailwind (or plain CSS) | Optional; keep it light. |
| Database | **PostgreSQL 16 + pgvector** | Relational core + semantic note search later. |
| Migrations | SQL files run in order (same tooling as `exam_questions`) | Auditable schema history. |
| Validation | **Zod** per route | Same convention. |
| AI | **Anthropic (Claude) Messages API** — structured output via tool use — through a single client, provider-swappable | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env`. |
| Container | **Docker Compose** | App + Postgres; deploy to Debian unchanged. |
| Reverse proxy | **Caddy** (as in `post16_lessons`) or nginx | TLS on the LAN, single entry point. |

### Stack decision: TypeScript (confirmed)

**Decided: TypeScript / Fastify**, to reuse `exam_questions` (your richest project) — its LLM
client, auth, HTMX patterns and backup scripts — and keep code shareable between the two.
A Python / FastAPI build was the considered alternative (it matches `post16_lessons` /
`computing_check`); both deploy identically via Docker to Debian, so this could be revisited
before Phase 0 if you change your mind. The rest of this document assumes TypeScript.

No queue/Redis initially. If background work appears (email polling, embedding batches,
nightly note summaries) add a single worker process or a cron-driven script — not a broker.
Phase 2.12's **recurring-task generator** is the first such job: an idempotent run on app boot + a
daily in-process timer, also exposed as `npm run generate-recurring` for system cron.

## Components

### Web layer (Fastify)

- One route per teacher action; HTMX for partial swaps (autosave a note, toggle a follow-up,
  log "actual" on a work block). No client-side router.
- All POSTs CSRF-protected; session cookie HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite=Strict.
- Per-route Zod schemas; validation failures render a templated message.

### Application services (where all logic lives)

- **ClockService** — given a `Date`, resolve weekday, current & next period, term/holiday
  status, and any `schedule_exceptions`. Single repeating week (no A/B cycle). Pure and
  unit-tested; the Now screen and "by next lesson" task rules both depend on it.
- **TimetableService** — render the week/day grid; resolve a date to its real occurrences.
- **OccurrenceService** — find-or-create the dated occurrence for a slot; attach plan/notes.
- **NotesService** — fast create/autosave; promote follow-ups to tasks; tag; search.
- **TaskService** — inbox/triage/schedule/complete; resolve `due_rule` against the timetable.
- **WorkBlockService** — plan time, record actual vs. planned (the "diverted" path).
- **ResourceService** — upload, version, preview/download and AI-edit resources for a
  plan/occurrence (the single source of truth).
- **AvailabilityService** — compute the real **work windows** for a day (free periods +
  before/after school) by subtracting teaching, clubs, break/lunch, meetings and `events`.
- **EventService** — parents' evenings, EHCP reviews, report deadlines; lead-time reminders and
  prep-task generation.
- **FocusService** — pick the **single next action** for "now" from urgency, `due_rule`,
  available window and `cognitive_load`; serve the end-of-day wind-down.
- **EmailIntakeService** — turn an ingested email into a task (method TBD — see below).
- **PlanningAssistant (AI)** — next-lesson draft, term summary, curriculum redesign.

### Repositories (SQL)

- Thin functions over `pg`. No ORM required (matches `exam_questions`); SQLAlchemy if Python.

### LLM client (one wrapper)

- Single entry point for every AI call. Responsibilities: **redact pupil names → tokens**
  (from `pupils.ai_token`), select provider/model from `settings`, call with structured-output
  schema, and write an `ai_calls` audit row containing only the **redacted** request.
- **Provider = Anthropic (Claude), by default.** Suggested models: planning/authoring →
  Sonnet (`claude-sonnet-4-6`); heavy curriculum design → Opus (`claude-opus-4-8`); cheap
  categorisation/tagging → Haiku (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`). Structured output via **tool
  use**; large repeated context (a scheme of work + recent notes) uses prompt caching.
- Swapping provider/model touches only this file. **Safeguarding-flagged content is withheld
  here — never sent to the AI** (see SECURITY_AND_PRIVACY). Implementation follows the project's
  `claude-api` reference at build time.

### Scheduler / clock source

- The app trusts the server clock (the Debian box keeps NTP). The Now screen polls or uses a
  small HTMX `hx-trigger="every 30s"` to advance the current period; no websockets needed.

### Resource storage (the app is the single source of truth)

Resources are **uploaded to and served by the app**, replacing today's scattered copies. Files
live on a dedicated **disk volume** (path in `settings`); metadata and version history live in
the DB (`resources` / `resource_versions`).

- **Upload / view / download.** PDFs and images preview in the browser directly; Office formats
  (docx/pptx/xlsx) download to open, with optional in-browser preview via a **server-side render
  to PDF** (e.g. headless LibreOffice in a sidecar container). The corpus is mostly
  **PowerPoint + Word + some PDF + media files** (every GCSE / Curriculum lesson).
- **Versioned.** Every change (teacher or AI) writes a new `resource_versions` row and advances
  `current_version_id`, so edits are reviewable and reversible.
- **AI edits (as far as possible).** Goal: AI-generated **worksheets stay editable for pupils**
  and **presentations look good** — the underlying format is secondary. Practical path: generate
  structured content (Markdown/HTML/JSON) and render to editable **DOCX/PPTX** (a templating /
  headless-Office step), saved as a new version. Pupils currently receive resources via **MS
  Teams assignments**, so "assign to Teams" stays a key step.
- **Import.** A script ingests existing scattered copies from a share/folder, hashing each
  (`checksum`) to flag duplicates so you consolidate to one canonical copy.
- **Backups now include the file store**, not just the database — see Deployment.

scripts/                        # backup.sh, restore.sh, import-eml.ts, deploy notes
```

## Deployment (school Debian server)

1. `docker compose up -d --build` brings up Fastify + Postgres (+ an optional headless-LibreOffice
   sidecar for Office previews). A named **volume holds the resource file-store**. `restart: unless-stopped`.
2. Caddy terminates TLS and proxies to the app on the LAN hostname (e.g. `organiser.school.internal`).
3. Migrations run on boot (or via `docker compose exec app npm run migrate`).
4. **Backups (non-negotiable — notes *and now resource files* are irreplaceable):** nightly
   `pg_dump` **plus a snapshot of the resource file-store volume**, from `scripts/backup.sh` to a
   local path the school's existing off-site backup already sweeps; keep N daily + M weekly;
   **test the restore** at least once. Document in a RUNBOOK.
5. Survives power loss: Compose restart policy + Postgres durability; no in-memory state that
   matters.

## Resilience & "useful offline"

- If the AI provider is unreachable, AI panels show a clear "unavailable" state and every
  manual feature keeps working.
- If the browser briefly loses the LAN, in-progress note text is preserved client-side and
  re-submitted (HTMX retry / local draft) so a half-written observation is never lost.

## Email intake — three candidate mechanisms (decide later)

1. **Forward-to-mailbox + IMAP poll.** A dedicated address; a scheduled script pulls new mail
   into `email_intake`. Most automatic; needs mailbox credentials in `.env`.
2. **Paste box.** A textarea where you paste an email; it's parsed into a task. Zero infra.
3. **`.eml` drop.** Save/forward emails into `data/imports/`; `scripts/import-eml.ts` ingests.

Recommendation: ship **(2) paste box** in the first task phase (no infrastructure), add **(1)**
later if the volume justifies it. See OPEN_QUESTIONS.

## Why not a SPA / heavier stack

One user on a LAN doing many short interactions: server-rendered HTML + HTMX is faster to
build, faster to load, trivially backed up, and matches the proven `exam_questions` approach.
A React/Vue SPA would add a build pipeline and API surface for no user-visible benefit here.
